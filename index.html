            <p>Baby, I don’t know if words could ever really capture how lucky I am to call you my boyfriend. When you asked me to be yours just about a month ago, my heart felt like it was going to burst. In that moment, I knew you were everything I’d been waiting for, and every single day since, you've shown me what it means to love and be loved so deeply. I am completely obsessed with you, baby. You mean everything to me.</p>
            <p>There’s something so sweet about just saying your name, Toni, my Toni, my baby. It feels like music to my soul knowing you’re mine. I love being your girlfriend, I love every moment I get to spend with you, and I love calling you my boyfriend. I think about you constantly, dream about you every night, and all I can see is a forever with you. I want to be by your side through all of it—the good, the bad, and all the magic in between.</p>
            <p>Today is your day, baby, and I just want to remind you how much I love you. From your laugh to the way you look at me, to how you make me feel like I’m the only girl in the world, you make my heart race. You’re my today, my tomorrow, my everything. I love you, baby, forever and always, and I can't wait to keep building this beautiful life together, hand in hand.</p>
